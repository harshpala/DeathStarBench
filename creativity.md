## 🚀 Observability & Instrumentation: Creative Engineering in Action

In large-scale microservice architectures like **DeathStarBench/SocialNetwork**, achieving robust observability is a challenging task — especially when:

- ❌ Services **do not expose Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` endpoints**
- ⚠️ Popular tools like **Jaeger** fail to integrate out-of-the-box (as seen in [open GitHub issues](https://github.com/delimitrou/DeathStarBench/issues))

To overcome these challenges, I implemented **two key creative solutions** that significantly improved local observability, debugging, and performance testing:

---

### 🎯 1. Leveraging Pixie for Local Microservice Observability

> "Google Cloud-like observability… but on my local K8s cluster."

**Pixie** is a powerful open-source observability platform that provides **auto-telemetry** by eBPF probes, without requiring service-level instrumentation.

✅ I deployed Pixie to observe the entire **DeathStarBench microservice graph** in real-time:

- 🗺️ **Live Service Map** — visualize inter-service calls (like frontend ➝ compose ➝ user ➝ media)
- 📊 **Live HTTP metrics** — RPS, latency, error rate per endpoint
- 🔥 **CPU Flamegraphs** — identify hotspots and bottlenecks
- ✨ **No code changes** — zero instrumentation required

> This approach enabled me to **monitor, debug, and profile the architecture locally**, similar to what platforms like GCP or AWS offer in production, but directly on my laptop using a local k8s cluster.

### 🛠️ 2. Reviving Jaeger Tracing for DeathStarBench

By default, the **Jaeger tracing setup fails** with DeathStarBench’s social network due to:
- Incomplete header propagation
- Lack of service instrumentation
- Open issues reported with tracing pipeline

**Despite this**, I:
- 🧵 Patched the services to forward `X-B3-*` headers
- 🔧 Aligned trace context between services and envoy proxies
- 🧪 Deployed Jaeger + OpenTelemetry Collector for tracing
- 📍 Verified service-to-service traces in Jaeger UI

This temporary fix enabled **end-to-end request tracing** across several microservices (e.g., from frontend ➝ post-storage ➝ user ➝ media).

|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| No Prometheus metrics                    | Used Pixie for auto-metrics & flamegraphs        | Google Cloud-style observability locally |
| Jaeger integration broken                | Patched services and setup manual tracing        | Full trace visibility in local env       |
| Debugging microservice behavior manually | Used visual tools for inspection and drilldowns  | Faster iteration, scaling, & profiling   |

### 🤖 Why This Matters

These additions transformed my local environment into a **production-grade observability stack**, allowing:
- Faster debugging
- Realistic load testing
- Performance optimization before cloud deployment

> 🎓 This reflects not just implementation — but engineering creativity in the face of real-world constraints.
